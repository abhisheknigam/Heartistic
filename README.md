NYU Hackathon - https://devpost.com/software/heartistic


# Inspiration
"More than 5 Million people in USA alone suffer from some kind of Heart Disease". This fact inspired us to create something using current technology inorder to assist these people regaining a health Heart life.The number just gives a fact of people suffering, but there is also a fact that "1 in 4 deaths is due to heart diseases in USA" . The numbers are shocking but true.

# What it does
Having the technology of fitness trackers in your watch(iWatch), high connectivity now-a-days to dear ones and medical assistance, we tried to integrate all together to bring a new heart-disease detection tool, notifying to dear-ones in case of emergency automatically and creating a unique fitness schedule as well as tracker to make you live a healthy heart life.

# How we built it
We tried a new way of integrating Hybrid IONIC app(in javascript) with iWatch to control and receive fitness data from watch, monitor user's Heart lifestyle.

# Challenges we ran into
Hybrid app that too with iWatch - in itself is a new thing to try. Integration with iWatch controlling it using plugins available(not so reliable yet) and then later on tweaking those plugins to suite our needs, a big task to accomplish.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully integrated a Hybrid App with iWatch. Calculated a formula using pulse rate, daily workout, rest and normal acitivity of user in detecting heart health and thus suggesting fitness schedule to improve heart health.

# What we learned
Health related facts - issues faced by current unhealthy population. iWatch capabilities, features available through API. HealthKit API of iWatch. Writing plugins for integration of javascript and IOS.

# What's next for Heartistic
Move ahead to add functionalities related to tracking more health information of the user. Play an important part in improving day-to-day health activities of user by suggesting as well as tracking activities through pulse rate, step count, workout and rest lifecycles.
